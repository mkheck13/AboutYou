    <h3>A little info about me</h3>
    <p class="spaceOut">
      Hi, my name is Michael. Today Im going to share some details about who I
      am. First off I was born in the early 80's on a Friday the 13th. I have
      been a proud Stockton resident all my life. Little known fact about me is
      that I am a Eagle Scout. I have worked in various types of work thru the
      years. Due to a chance meeting I have decided to pivot into a new career
      path in coding.
    </p>
